# Whiteboard
Team Members: Jacqueline Zhang, Joy Chu, Priyanka Goswami, Ryan Qiao, William Zhang

### Project Idea:
Being in a remote world, one of the biggest challenges is to have everyone on the same page. Whiteboard serves as the best solution to bring people back together while it enables real-time editing, drawing, and communication. 

Whiteboard provides powerful functions including:
* Real-time editing, drawing, and communication in annotations
* Modes for Editing (to draw and create things), View (to annotate and highlight things), and Presenting (to present ideas)
* Basic drawing and erasing functions (pen choosing, color picking, font size picking, eraser size choosing, etc.)
* Lasso selection to move or delete
* Files organizing and saving
* Exporting to jpeg, png, or pdf
* Managing members in the group (adding and removing members)
* Inserting pictures, videos, and texts

APIs:
* Websocket - https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws#api-docs
* AWW - https://awwapp.com/apis/?fbclid=IwAR1hXxgfolGHJ6l6xdiR7altgh3FiqUpOK7X9Xo3t6KQHmvnWyD-S_GMmcQ

### TA Comments (Nov. 1 2020)
- Feasibility: The two APIs well support your goal and seem easy-to-use. You might face some challenges of incorporating them with React.
- Scope: The scope is moderate. It just seems that most features have been supported by the AWW API. You might want to think about adding something to it.  
- Requirements: All satisfied.
